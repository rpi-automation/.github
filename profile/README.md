# Raspberry Pi Automation

This project aims to provide a comprehensive automation infrastructure for Raspberry Pi devices, leveraging Ansible and workflow automation tools to simplify management and boost productivity.

## Repositories Overview

### rpi-virtualisation-infra-ansible

This repository contains Ansible playbooks and roles designed to automate the infrastructure setup and configuration of Raspberry Pi devices. 
It includes virtualization setups, system provisioning, and best practices for managing Raspberry Pi environments at scale. 

### rpi-automation-services-n8n

This repository hosts the configuration and workflows for deploying n8n, a powerful open-source workflow automation tool, on Raspberry Pi devices. 
It facilitates automation of background tasks, integrates various services, and enables event-driven workflows directly on your Raspberry Pi. 
This adds a flexible automation layer for handling complex task orchestration without relying on cloud services.

## Project Goals

* Simplify Raspberry Pi infrastructure provisioning through Ansible automation.
* Enable local and reliable workflow automation using n8n.
* Reduce manual configuration and increase operational efficiency.
